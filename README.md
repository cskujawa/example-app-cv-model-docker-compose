Used this example project [here](https://github.com/streamlit/example-app-cv-model) as a foundation for this app.
I forked that repo to made it into a docker compose project, added in additional CV models to compare, set the results to sort by the confidence score, and if 3 or more models had 50% or greater confidence it gets a poem written by ChatGPT.
